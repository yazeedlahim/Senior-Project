# Senior-Project
The project introduces a mobile application that serves as an interactive room where
the admin and participants can communicate in a more productive way. The mobile
application lets the admin create a room and add the participants names. Those attended will
be able to participate in different activities initiated and managed by the admin. The activities
can be anything that can take place inside a real room. Examples include quizzes, contests and
brainstorming. The application offers the admin the option to create groups of participants
either randomly or based on past performance. Furthermore, the application presents
scheduling options that will ease meetings and appointments between the admin and
participants.
